# CLI Weather App

A simple command-line tool that fetches current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Fetches real-time temperature, “feels like” temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Supports metric (°C), imperial (°F), or standard (Kelvin) units.
- Easy to install and run with just Python 3 and the `requests` library.
- Stores no data locally—just reads your API key from an environment variable.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer  
- An [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api)
